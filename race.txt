This is a bug in multithreading and it occurs when two threads tries to access the same 
variable resulting in unreliable output.

Race Condition can be controlled by using locks,Rlocks or semaphores

Steps for creating a lock along with acquire and release locks

from threading import *

mylock=Lock()
mylock.acquire() #this is meant for locking
mylock.release() #this is meant for unlocking


#acquire has two parameters
mylock.acquire([blocking=True],timeout=-1)
